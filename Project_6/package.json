The WCA governs competitions for twisted puzzles, with the widely know \"Rubik's Cube\" as most popular event. In this project, I will create a visualization for the number of competitions individual competitors have attended. I recently attended my 100th competition, which makes me the 25th person ever to reach this benchmark.",
